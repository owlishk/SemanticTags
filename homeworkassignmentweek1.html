          <figcaption>They made us wear old timey costumes with scary masks during orientation.  </figcaption>

      <p>During orientation we learned how to maintain our costumes and what to do if someone peed with fright. We also learned where the break room was and how to leave the house without running into paying customers.</p>

      <p>In addition to the basics, we learned different techniques to frighten cusomers, or what management likes to call "clients". Management paid a fancy design firm to develop personas and a "scarability" continuum, from least scarable to most scarable. According to our instructor, kids and old people are the hardest to scare. She also said there's an direct, statistically proven, relationship with visible tattoos and scarability--the more tattoos you see the easier they are to scare. Who knew?</p>

      <p>We also had to sign a mountain of waivers, many of which had to do with physical harm. Apparently if I get hit in the face by a scared client, the company is not liable for any corrective surgery that is considered cosmetic in nature. <em>I thought that was cheap.</em></p>
